This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python
for people with little or no previous programming experience.
It uses plotting as its motivating example,
and is designed to be used in both [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }})
and [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops.
The first half of this lesson references the Jupyter Notebook,
but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter as well.
The second half of the lessons are intended to be writen using a
text editor.
Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.
