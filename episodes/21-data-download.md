> ## Review From Yesterday
> 
> In your notebook, write a function that determines whether a year between 1901 and 2000 is a leap year, 
> where it prints a message like "1904 is a leap year" or "1905 is not a leap year" as 
> output.  Use this function to evaluate the years 1928, 1950, 1959, 1972 and 1990.    
> 
> Hint: the percent symbol '%' is the modular operator in Python.  So: 
>
> ~~~
> print('8 mod 4 equals', 8 % 4)
> print('10 mod 4 equals', 10 % 4)
> ~~~
> {: .python}
> ~~~
> 8 mod 4 equals 0
> 10 mod 4 equals 2
> ~~~
> {: .output}

> > ## Suggested Approach
> > 
> > First, try to determine how to use the mod operator `%` to determine 
> > if a year is divisible by 4 (and thus a leap year or not).  
> > 
> > Then, create a conditional statement to use this information, and put 
> > it into a function.  
> > 
> > Finally, create a list of the years given in the exercise.  Use a for loop 
> > and your function to evaluate these years.  
> > 
> {: .solution}

> > ## Modular Arthimetic
> > 
> > If a year in the range specified is divisible by four, it is a leap year.  
> > If a number is divisible by 4, then the arithmetic expression "number mod four" (or 
> > `num % 4` in Python) will equal zero.

> 1. Expand your function so that it correctly categorizes 
> any year from 0 onwards
> 
> 1. Instead of printing whether a year is a leap year or not, save 
> the results to a python dictionary, where there are two keys ("leap"
> and "not-leap") and the values are a list of years.
