# Reflection exercise

While eating lunch, meet some of your fellow learners!

Some topics on which to reflect:

*   How is python different from other languages you know?
    *   Consider collections, loops, functions.
    *   Are there things that you know from other languages that would be
       easier in python?  harder?
